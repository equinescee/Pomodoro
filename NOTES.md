# Development Notes

## Hardware Recommendations (June 2024)

### Getting Started Setup
- MacBook Air M4
- 16GB Unified Memory
- 512GB SSD
- Perfect for:
  - Web development
  - Learning programming
  - Running development servers
  - Using VS Code/Cursor
  - Basic development tasks

### Future-Proof Setup
- MacBook Pro M4 Pro/Max
- 32GB+ Unified Memory
- 1TB+ SSD
- Ideal for:
  - Native app development
  - Local AI/ML development
  - Running multiple development environments
  - Complex Docker setups
  - Heavy compilation tasks

### Notes on Unified Memory
- Single pool of memory shared between CPU, GPU, Neural Engine
- More efficient than traditional RAM
- 16GB Unified Memory can perform like traditional 16GB RAM + separate VRAM
- Dynamic resource allocation

## Learning Path
- Started with vanilla JavaScript for fundamentals
- Plan to learn React for more complex applications
- Future areas to explore:
  - State management
  - Component architecture
  - Modern build tools
